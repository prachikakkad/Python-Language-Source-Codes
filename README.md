I am uploading the source code on my github profile to keep it safe for me. 
Anyone can use my code and upload it to their git/github also.
I don't have any problem on that. But please don't use it commercially. 
I have problem on that. 
Because it is free for everyone. 
So using it commerially is not good/fair/correct.
